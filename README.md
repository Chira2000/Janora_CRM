Introduction:

An order management system is a critical
component of any restaurant's operations as
it allows the restaurant staff to manage
orders effectively and efficiently. With the
increasing demand for convenience and
speed of service, restaurants need to adopt
technology solutions that streamline their
operations and enhance the customer
experience. In this regard, an order
management system that is integrated with smart devices such as tablets can be a game-changer for restaurant operations.
Janora Café is one of the best family restaurants in the Gampaha district. Janora Café is the best place for Special family dinners & Events, outdoor catering, Lunch buffets, and BBQ dinners. Over these 4 years they haven’t come down in quality, most of their customers confirmed that it’s the best place to have dinner with your loved ones for quality foods at a reasonable price.
The order management system that we are proposing for Janora Cafe is a customer-touching CRM that enables the customers who come to the restaurant to place orders and record them automatically. The system facilitates the restaurant management to add, delete, and update orders as per the customer's requirements. The system also integrates with a kitchen display system (KDS), enabling the kitchen staff to view the orders in real-time and prepare them accordingly. This integration can significantly reduce order processing time, minimize errors, and improve the overall efficiency of the restaurant's operations.
When customers come into the restaurant, all will receive a tablet. There are three options. If the customer is new to the cafe and is willing to enjoy the loyalty member benefits, he/she can register and create an account by simply providing his/her name and phone number. If you're not interested in being a loyalty customer, you can choose guest mode and place the orders. If a customer has visited the cafe before, the customer can directly log into the previously his/her account and order food as usual. After ordering the food using a virtual menu, the order will be transmitted to admin for the approval . Then the admin will confirm or reject the order made
 
by the customer. If it is confirmed, then the order is transmitted to the kitchen and the cashier. The system also integrates with a kitchen display system (KDS), enabling the kitchen staff to view the orders in real-time and prepare them accordingly. This integration can significantly reduce order processing time, minimize errors, and improve the overall efficiency of the restaurant's operations. Then the kitchen staff will start preparing food for the confirmed orders. If it is rejected, a notification will be sent to the customer saying that the order is rejected. After serving the order, the bill will be sent to the customer's table by a server, and customers can easily pay their bills either using cash or debit or credit cards.
In our report, we will provide a detailed analysis of the order management system, including its functionalities, design, and development process. We will also discuss the benefits of the system for Janora Cafe and how it can enhance the restaurant's operations and customer experience. We hope that this report will provide valuable insights into the order management system and its potential applications in the restaurant industry.
